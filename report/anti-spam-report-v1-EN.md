    This report analyzes five anti-spam filters—Akismet, CleanTalk, OOPSpam, ModerationAPI, and ALTCHA Spam Filter—evaluating their GDPR compliance, accuracy, latency, and features. Most solutions struggle with data privacy compliance and show variable accuracy, often failing to detect spam reliably or generating false positives. Latency issues also affect their suitability for real-time applications.

    ALTCHA Spam Filter excels with high accuracy, comprehensive language support, and robust privacy measures, making it the preferred choice for users needing a fast, reliable, and GDPR-compliant anti-spam solution. This report highlights the need for anti-spam filters that ensure both high detection accuracy and adherence to data privacy standards.

## Preface

Server-side anti-spam solutions have been available for a significant period, including widely-known options such as Akismet and CleanTalk. However, their adoption outside of websites powered by WordPress has been limited, primarily due to their low classification accuracy and lack of advanced features, as illustrated in this report.

For many years, CAPTCHAs have been the dominant solution in the anti-spam market, providing reliable spam protection. However, with the emergence of new machine learning systems and Large Language Models (LLMs), it is now possible to achieve fast and highly accurate text classification, making server-side and real-time spam filters a viable option for websites and APIs.

### Spam Filters Over CAPTCHAs

When protecting your website from spam, choosing the right solution is crucial. While CAPTCHAs are popular, server-side anti-spam solutions offer several compelling advantages that make them superior:

1. **Seamless User Experience**: CAPTCHAs can frustrate users with their often difficult and time-consuming challenges. Server-side solutions work silently in the background, providing a seamless experience without disrupting user engagement.

2. **Enhanced Security**: Server-side anti-spam solutions utilize advanced algorithms and machine learning to detect and block spam with higher accuracy. This approach can detect even sophisticated human and AI-generated spam, ensuring robust protection for your website.

3. **Accessibility**: CAPTCHAs can pose accessibility issues for users with disabilities, making it difficult for them to navigate your site. Server-side solutions eliminate this barrier, ensuring your website is inclusive and accessible to all users.

4. **Faster Performance**: CAPTCHAs can slow down page load times, negatively impacting user experience and SEO rankings. Server-side solutions operate efficiently without affecting the speed of your website.

In this report, we evaluate several commercially available spam filters—**Akismet, CleanTalk, OOPSpam, ModerationAPI, ChatGPT, and ALTCHA Spam Filter**—measuring their performance and accuracy of classification, and evaluating their privacy policies to highlight potential privacy and compliance issues.

## Methodology

This section outlines the systematic approach employed to evaluate the performance, accuracy, and compliance of various spam filters. The methodology is designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and reproducibility of the results.

### Objectives and Scope

The primary objective of this evaluation is to measure the performance and accuracy of selected spam filters in classifying user-submitted data across multiple languages. Additionally, the privacy policies of these filters are examined for compliance with GDPR and other relevant regulations.

### Accuracy Tests

To evaluate the accuracy of the spam filters, we prepared a comprehensive set of 50 test samples, generated by ChatGPT. These samples are designed to reflect common messages submitted via contact forms, including both legitimate (non-spam) and spam content. The samples cover text in seven languages: English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and Dutch. The evaluation criteria are as follows:

- **Legitimate Samples**: Messages that are genuine and non-spam.
- **Spam Samples**: Messages that contain spam or harmful content, including pills and drugs advertisements, profanity, and harmful code (e.g., SQL/HTML injection).

Each sample was submitted to the spam filters using their respective HTTP APIs. The classification results were compared with the expected outcomes to calculate accuracy scores. A test is considered _passed_ if the platform correctly classifies the sample as either spam or non-spam.

### Latency Tests

To measure the average latency of each spam filter, we conducted five consecutive classifications using the same content (text only). The latency, defined as the full HTTP round-trip time, was recorded. Tests were conducted from AWS data centers located in two regions:

- **EU Region**: AWS eu-central-1
- **US Region**: AWS us-west-1

By testing from these locations, we ensured a comprehensive assessment of the response times from different geographical points.

### Statistical Analysis

The accuracy was determined by the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total number of samples. Latency was averaged across the five tests for each region to provide a representative measure of performance.

### Transparency and Reproducibility

The source code and samples used in this evaluation are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/altcha-org/altcha-vs-akismet) [^1]. This transparency allows for independent verification and reproduction of the tests, ensuring the credibility of our findings.

## Conclusion

The evaluation of various anti-spam filters reveals two critical areas of concern: compliance with data privacy regulations and the accuracy of spam classification. 

Firstly, most anti-spam filters struggle with GDPR compliance. This is a significant issue as these filters often handle customer data that may include personal information. Using a non-compliant platform not only risks legal penalties but also undermines user trust and damages the company’s reputation. Even in regions not bound by GDPR, respecting customer privacy has become a standard expectation and best practice.

Secondly, the accuracy of these filters varies significantly. Many of the tested solutions showed poor performance, either generating false positives or failing to detect actual spam. An unreliable spam filter defeats its own purpose, necessitating additional measures or manual reviews to ensure data integrity.

Latency is another important factor for real-time spam filtering. Filters need to operate swiftly to avoid impacting website performance. The tests revealed that while some platforms maintained stable latency, others exhibited fluctuations that could hinder real-time usability. However, these platforms might still be suitable for asynchronous data processing.

Among the tested solutions, ALTCHA's Spam Filter stood out with its exemplary performance and accuracy across all languages. Its commitment to GDPR compliance and robust privacy policies make it an ideal choice for those seeking a reliable, real-time spam filtering solution. ALTCHA not only meets the demands for high accuracy but also ensures data privacy, positioning it as the preferred option for modern, privacy-conscious applications.
